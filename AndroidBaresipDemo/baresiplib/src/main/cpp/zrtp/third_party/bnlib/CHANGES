1.1.4
- Added bnBasePrecompCopy, bnDoubleBasePrecompExpMod, and corresponding
  lbn* functions.
- Fixed some stupid bugs in bnExtractBigBytes and bnExtractLittleBytes
  when asking for more bytes than the numbers have.

1.1.3
1999-05-09
- Added bnBasePrecompBegin, bnBasePrecompEnd and bnBasePrecompExpMod,
  and corresponding lbn* functions.
- Added some rudimentary tests of the above to bntest.
- Updated dsatest to use the new functions.  Speedup on 1024 bits seems
  to be about 3x.

1.1.2:
1998-06-22
- Added bnReadBit function
- Fixed corruption in bnMakeOdd_16
- Clarified comments in germain.c
- Fixed nasty bug in lbnModQ_16 in lbn80386.asm
- renamed rand parameter to randFunc in prime.c to avoid warnings

1.1.1:
- Cleaned up some test directory code
	
1.1: Second public release

- Generalized Sophie Germain primes to variable "orders",
  which is the number of 2*p+1 levels that are all prime.
  An order-0 primeis an ordinary prime.  An order-1 prime is
  a Sophie Germain prime.  An order-3 prime also has 4*p+3 prime.
  (Changed hours before release; I wonder if there are bugs?)
- Figured out that if p and 2*p+1 are prime, it's p that's called
  a Sophie Germain prime, not 2*p+1.  germain.c and germtest.c
  updated accordingly.  2*p+1 is called a "strong prime".
- Updated to not use 16-bit MSDOS-isms like "cdecl" with GCC under GO32.
- Fixed a bug in primeGen() that caused it to do strange things
  if the first number in the sieve passed.
- Fixed a memory leak in lbnExpMod
- Fixed bug in lbn80386.asm lbnModQ_32 (was a complete mess)
- Fixed bug in bnDoubleExpMod (one-character change; masked a bug in SKIP!)
- Fixed a bug in error recovery in lbnInv
- Added out-of-memory checking to bntest
- Installation documentation improved, especially for non-Unix platforms.
- Preprocessor trickery made compatible with some ancient sort-of-ANSI
  compilers.  To be precise:
  - Not liking "#if FOO" when FOO is not defined (ANSI says FOO is "0")
  - Not liking long constants without "l" (ANSI says all pp math is long)
- bnInit() made redundant; now called automatically by bnBegin().
- bnCmpQ(struct BigNum const *, unsigned) added.
- Removed copyright disclaimers from some files so as not to confuse lawyers.
- Spell-checked, corrected and improved comments in lbn16.c.  Especially
  added a big description of Montgomery representation.
- Added parens a few places to shut up compiler warnings.
- Added 386 support for Unix and some GCC-specific inline assembler tricks.
- Got rid of some warnings in lbn8086.h.
- Improved PowerPC inline assembler for CodeWarrior 8.
