Rsatest is a test driver for RSA operations.

Rsatest takes a list of vecimal key sizes (in bits) on the command
line, and generates keys of those sizes.  It generates keys randomly,
using keyboard timings for a random number source, then tests the
resultant keys, doing an encryption, a decryption, a signing and a
verification.

Example invocation lines:

rsatest 512 768 1024
rsatest 2048
