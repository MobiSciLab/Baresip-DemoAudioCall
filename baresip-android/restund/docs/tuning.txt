In order to reduce packet loss when processing load
is high, you may have to adjust the maximum size of
your socket buffers.

On Linux this can be done with the following command
for read and write buffers respectively:

echo 1048576 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
echo 1048576 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
